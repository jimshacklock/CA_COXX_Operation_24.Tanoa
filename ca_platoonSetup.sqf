// CA Hierarchy setup 
// Author: Poulern (@me for issues)
// Server execution only and run once at the start of mission

//Side tickets available (Where one ticket = 1 respawn, default 5 for vehicles) per team in addition to the group tickets;
// Change to for example _caEastTickets = 49 if needed for TvTs/events with multiple sides
_caWestTickets = 50;
_caEastTickets = _caWestTickets;
_caIndependentTickets = _caWestTickets;

/*
Parameters for ca_fnc_setupGroup, which is what the setup inside the _hierarchywest block uses to setup each group. 
 * 0: Side (Side): This is set automatically, if you need to set up for multiple sides copy the _hierachy code block and name it _westhierarchy, _easthierachy etc. as needed and change the call below.
 * 1: Superior (String): The groupid of the group that ranks above it in the hierarchy, if equal to groupid, then the group is an independent group or its own platoon.
 * 2:  Groupid (String): The groupid that is set in the editor field callsign.
 * 3: Short range radio channel (Number): What channel the 343 will be on by default and on respawn. 
 * 4: Long range radio Array (Array): Array of channels the long range radios will be on by default and on respawn. There will be one radio given per channel to ranks set in ca_acre2settings.sqf
 * 5: Group color (String): The color of the group in the hierarchy and its groupmarker. Available colors: "ColorBlack","ColorGrey","ColorRed","ColorBrown","ColorOrange","ColorYellow","ColorKhaki","ColorGreen","ColorBlue","ColorPink","ColorWhite"
 * 6: Group tickets (Number): The number of tickets this group gets to play with at the start of the mission. 
 * 7: Group marker (Boolean): Should each team get a group marker assigned to them? Default: True. 
 * 8: Group type (String): What markertype the unit has. This is if you want to use the non-automatic mode that the groupmarker uses. For non smooth markers its any A3 marker, for smooth markers its "b_hq","b_inf","b_support","b_motor_inf","b_mortar","b_maint","b_mech_inf","b_armor","b_recon","b_air","b_plane","b_art"
